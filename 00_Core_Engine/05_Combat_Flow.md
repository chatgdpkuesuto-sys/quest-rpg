# Combat Flow

## Overview
Combat is cyclic, organized into **Rounds** and **Turns**.
1 **Round** ≈ 6 seconds in game time.

## 1. Combat Step-by-Step
1.  **Determine Surprise**: DM determines who is surprised.
    - *Surprised*: Cannot move or take Actions/Reactions until after your first turn ends.
2.  **Establish Positions**: DM decides where everyone is located.
3.  **Roll Initiative**: Everyone rolls `1d20 + DEX Mod`.
    - *Tie*: DM decides order for monsters; players decide for themselves.
4.  **Take Turns**: Participants act in Initiative order.
5.  **Begin Next Round**: Repeat from Step 4 until combat ends.

## 2. Your Turn
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your **Speed** and take **1 Action**.

### Bonus Actions
- You can take only **one** Bonus Action per turn.
- You must have a specific ability, spell, or feature that grants a Bonus Action (e.g., Two-Weapon Fighting, Rogue's Cunning Action).
- Can be taken at any time during your turn.

### Other Activity
- You can communicate briefly (short sentences/gestures) for free.
- You can interact with **one** object for free (draw a sword, open a door).
- Interacting with a *second* object requires the **Use an Object** Action.

## 3. Reactions
- An instant response to a trigger, which can occur on your turn or someone else's.
- **Limit**: Once per round. Regain reaction at the start of your turn.
- **Common Triggers**:
    - **Opportunity Attack**: Enemy moves out of your reach.
    - **Readied Action**: Trigger condition is met.
    - **Spells**: *Shield*, *Counterspell*, etc.
